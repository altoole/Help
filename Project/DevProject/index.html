    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Born before memory, Charles the Destroyer is the first and forever King of the Free City State of Dogtopia. Known for the great war where he successfully
      captured land between the nations of <em>Snorelandia</em> and <em>The United Sheets of Burrito</em> he fought hard for all Munchkinfaces finally securing them a nation of their own. With borders secure and peace treaties with the neighboring nations, he plans on spending the later years
    of his reign enjoying a quiet life.</p>

      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>Charles was born many years ago, though the exact date is not known by his subjects. It is often thought that he may in fact be a <em>God King</em> and is immortal and eternal. What we do know about the Kings youth - is that it did not end well. At one point, the King lost everything and was at least for some period of time living like a peasant on the streets.</p>
      <p>The King himself will not speak of these times, and chooses instead to remember the rise to power that he now has.</p>
